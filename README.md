# clied (command-line interface editors)

A short tutorial introducing CLI-editors titled "How do I edit a file in a Terminal? ðŸ¤·" at the [NCML](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/research-group-neurocognition-of-music-and-language.html) lab meeting (MPIEA, Frankfurt am Main, Germany) on 21 August 2024 by Seung-Goo KIM. I gladly share this with any member of the institute ðŸ¤— (or anyone on the internet since this is a public repo anywayðŸ˜„).
